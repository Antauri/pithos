# Support 
Here are a few places where you can get help getting started with
pithos:

## Irc

Pithos developers hang out in #pithosio on irc.freenode.net. The best
time to get questions answered will be 8am-5pm UTC.

The IRC channel logs are available at
[botbot.me](https://botbot.me/freenode/pithosio/).

## Github Issues

The [issue page](https://github.com/exoscale/pithos/issues) for pithos
will be the reference issue tracking mechanism.

## Mailing list

Send an email to pithos@librelist.com to subscribe. That first email is
dropped and subsequent emails are sent to the mailing-list.
