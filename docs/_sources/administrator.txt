Administrator Guide
===================

This section describes common operations and deploy strategies for
*pithos*.

Overview of configuration
-------------------------

Configuring *pithos* involves configuring the following components:

- At least one Apache Cassandra cluster
- Pithos itself
- An optional reverse proxy to handle SSL termination
- Client configuration

Choosing your topology
----------------------

Since *pithos* can target different clusters for its *bucketstore*, *metastore* and *blobstore* (cf :ref:`Pithos Architecture`). A simple deployment will most likely
use the same cluster and keyspace for all data while a multi-region large set-up would
span several clusters: a multi-DC one holding the *bucketstore* and DC-local ones
for the *metastores* and *blobstores*.
